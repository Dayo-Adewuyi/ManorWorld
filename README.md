## Conclusion

Our aim when building Manor was to try and make a contribution to a more decentralised social media, where users donâ€™t have to worry about their data, and where they have full control over their content.

Manor is built on chain and so is by nature decentralised, it uses decentralised protocols such as IPFS. This means greater privacy and security for users, as their data is not stored on a central server that could be vulnerable to hacking or other security threats.
